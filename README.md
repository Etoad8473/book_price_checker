This is a small js app that uses your webcam to capture an image of a book and tries to find the book info

How to use:
live server the html page
allow your browser to use the webcam (might be denied by default, on chrome to the left of the url click the settings icon and allow webcam usage)
hold book up to webcam and press capture
it might take a few shots to get correct
in console it will print an array of book information

-this is a barebones app, will be improving later for look and functionality
